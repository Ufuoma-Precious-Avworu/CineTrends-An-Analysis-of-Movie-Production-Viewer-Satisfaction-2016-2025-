**PROJECT REPORT: An Analysis of Movie Production and Viewer Satisfaction (2016-2025)**  

### 1. Problem Statement  
The movie industry is constantly evolving, influenced by various factors such as genre, language, and runtime, all of which affect both production trends and audience preferences. However, a comprehensive understanding of these factors remains unclear, particularly regarding their impact on movie popularity and viewer satisfaction. By leveraging data-driven insights, this analysis aims to provide valuable information for filmmakers, producers, and industry stakeholders to optimize content strategies and enhance audience engagement.  

### 2. Aims and Objectives  

**Aim:** To analyze movie industry trends and determine the factors influencing movie popularity and viewer satisfaction, focusing on genre, language, and runtime.  

**Objectives:**  
✅ To identify the most produced genres in recent years  
✅ To determine the most popular genre among viewers  
✅ To analyze which languages tend to receive the highest ratings  

### 3. Research Questions  

✅ What are the most produced genres from 2020 to 2025?  
✅ Is there a relationship between movie runtime and IMDb ratings?  
✅ Which language movies tend to receive higher ratings?  
✅ What are the trends in movie production over the years?  
✅ Which genres consistently perform well based on ratings?  

### 4. Methodology  

**Data Collection:**  
The data was collected from a secondary source (my instructor) and organized into an Excel spreadsheet.  

**Data Cleaning and Preparation:**  
Raw data was cleaned in the "Clean Data" sheet by removing duplicates, correcting errors, trimming unnecessary elements, and ensuring uniform formatting.  

**Data Analysis:**  
Pivot tables (Pivot Table sheet) were used to summarize genre production over the years, genre popularity based on ratings, the language with the highest ratings, and a scatter plot to compare runtime (in minutes) to ratings.  

### 5. Findings and Insights  

✅ **What are the most produced genres from 2020 to 2025?** The most produced genres are drama, documentary, comedy, thriller, and romance.  
✅ **Is there a relationship between movie runtime and IMDb ratings?** There is a moderate positive correlation between movie runtime and IMDb ratings—longer movies tend to have slightly higher ratings.  
✅ **Which language movies tend to receive higher ratings?** English, French, Japanese, Hindi, Spanish, and Korean films generally receive higher ratings.  
✅ **What are the trends in movie production over the years?** Drama, documentary, comedy, thriller, and romance genres remain dominant in production.  
✅ **Which genres consistently perform well based on ratings?** Drama, thriller, and documentary films consistently earn higher IMDb ratings.  

### 6. Recommendations  

✅ Since drama has been and continues to be the leading genre in movie production, filmmakers should continue leveraging its popularity. Documentaries, which are rapidly growing in demand, should also receive more attention, as audiences are increasingly drawn to real-life narratives and intellectually stimulating stories.  
✅ The popularity of genres such as comedy, thriller, and romance suggests that audiences seek both light entertainment and emotionally engaging stories. A balanced approach to storytelling—combining humor, suspense, and emotional appeal—can help maximize viewer engagement.  
✅ English-language films tend to receive higher IMDb ratings, possibly due to wider availability and better funding. However, non-English films, particularly Spanish, French, Japanese, Hindi, and Korean productions, also perform well. Increasing linguistic diversity in high-quality productions can expand global audiences and improve industry recognition.  

### 7. Conclusion  

This analysis revealed key trends and challenges within the movie industry. Movie production should not merely focus on quantity but must prioritize strong storytelling to enhance quality and viewer satisfaction.
